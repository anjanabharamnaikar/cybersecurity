# Network Security Project: Phishing Data Analysis

This project aims to enhance network security by analyzing and detecting phishing activities using real-world network data. Phishing is a prevalent cyber threat where attackers deceive users into revealing sensitive information by impersonating trustworthy entities. By leveraging machine learning and data analysis techniques, this project identifies patterns and indicators of phishing within network traffic, helping organizations to proactively defend against such attacks.

Key objectives:
- Collect and preprocess network data related to phishing attempts.
- Develop models to detect phishing activities.
- Provide insights and visualizations to understand phishing trends.

This repository contains the codebase, data processing scripts, and documentation for the project.
